# **Patina by Jason Reynolds – Presentation Script (Markdown Version)**

## **“Good morning everyone! My name is Saatvik and Today, I’ll be sharing a book talk on *Patina* by Jason Reynolds. This book focuses on a girl named Patty who’s learning about teamwork, trust, and personal growth through running.**

I’ll walk you through five sections of this book talk, moving through each slide in sequence.

## **Slide 1: SWBST (Somebody–Wanted–But–So–Then)**

Let’s begin with a quick SWBST summary of *Patina*. SWBST stands for Somebody–Wanted–But–So–Then, and it’s a great way to capture the essence of the story in just a few lines.

- **Somebody:** Patina, or Patty, is the main character.  
- **Wanted:** She wants to win the relay race and prove herself as part of the team.  
- **But:** She struggles with trust and teamwork because she’s used to doing everything on her own.  
- **So:** She has to learn to rely on her teammates and listen to her coach’s advice.  
- **Then:** Patty begins to understand that running a relay isn’t just about speed—it’s about connection and trust.

Basically, this shows Patty’s journey from independence to teamwork.

## **Slide 2: Close Reading**

Now, let’s look closely at the key passage from this book. In this passage, the girls are getting ready for the relay and the coach gives advice.

The coach says something like, *“It’s not just about running fast—it’s about passing the baton smoothly.”* This moment is important because it’s not just about sports—it’s about life. The coach is teaching them that success comes from working together, not just individual effort.

Patty feels nervous but determined. This sets the tone for the theme we’ll discuss next.

## **Slide 3: Theme**

The theme of this passage—and really the whole book—is **teamwork and trust**. Patty learns that even though she’s strong and independent, she can’t do everything alone. The relay becomes a symbol for life: you have to trust others to carry the baton forward.

I think this theme is powerful because it reminds us that asking for help isn’t weakness—it’s strength.

## **Slide 4: Craft (Foreshadowing & Symbolism)**

In this passage, Jason Reynolds uses **foreshadowing** and **symbolism**.

- **Foreshadowing:** The coach’s advice hints that something big will happen during the relay—maybe a challenge that tests their teamwork.  
- **Symbolism:** The baton isn’t just a stick—it represents trust and responsibility. Passing it smoothly means passing trust from one person to another.

It is really surprising how a simple object like a baton can carry such a big meaning.

## **Slide 5: Reflection**

Finally, my reflection.

Personally, I connected with Patty because I’ve also had moments where I wanted to do everything myself. But just like her, I learned that teamwork makes things better.

I would recommend *Patina* to anyone who loves stories about sports, family, and personal growth. It’s not just about running—it’s about life lessons.

**Thank you!**

If you want, I can also format this into a more polished presentation outline, add speaker notes, or convert it into a shorter script.
