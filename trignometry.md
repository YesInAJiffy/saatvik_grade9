# Sides forming Angles
In trigonometry, when we talk about **initial side** and **terminal side**, we are referring to the sides of an angle drawn in **standard position** on the coordinate plane.

***

### ✅ **Initial Side**

*   The **initial side** of an angle is the **starting position** of the angle.
*   In standard position, it **always lies along the positive x-axis**.
*   This is the fixed side from which the angle begins to rotate.

***

### ✅ **Terminal Side**

*   The **terminal side** is the **position after rotation**.
*   It shows where the angle ends after rotating from the initial side.
*   The rotation can be:
    *   **Counterclockwise** → Positive angle
    *   **Clockwise** → Negative angle

***

### ✅ **Significance**

*   The initial side is the reference point for measuring angles.
*   The terminal side determines the quadrant of the angle, which affects the **signs of trigonometric functions**.
*   The angle between the initial and terminal side is what we measure in degrees or radians.

# Reference Angles


### ✅ **What is a Reference Angle?**

In trigonometry, a **reference angle** is the **acute angle (between 0° and 90°)** formed between the terminal side of a given angle and the **x-axis** in standard position.

*   For any angle θ (positive or negative), its reference angle is the smallest positive angle between the terminal side of θ and the x-axis.
*   It is always **positive** and **≤ 90°**.

***

### ✅ **How to Find It?**

*   If θ is in **Quadrant I**: Reference angle = θ
*   If θ is in **Quadrant II**: Reference angle = 180° − θ
*   If θ is in **Quadrant III**: Reference angle = θ − 180°
*   If θ is in **Quadrant IV**: Reference angle = 360° − θ  
    *(For radians, use π instead of 180° and 2π instead of 360°.)*

Example:  
If θ = 210°, then reference angle = 210° − 180° = 30°.

***

### ✅ **Significance of Reference Angle**

*   **Simplifies Trigonometric Calculations:**  
    Trig functions of any angle can be expressed using its reference angle and the sign determined by the quadrant.
    $`
    \sin(210°) = -\sin(30°), \quad \cos(210°) = -\cos(30°)
    `$
*   **Helps with Unit Circle:**  
    All trig values repeat in patterns based on reference angles.
*   **Useful for Negative Angles and Angles > 360°:**  
    You reduce them to their reference angle for easier computation.

# **What is the meaning of “Period” in a function?**

The **period** of a function is the length of the smallest interval after which the function **repeats its values**.

Mathematically:
$`
f(x + T) = f(x)
`$
for all ( x ), where ( T ) is the **period**.

***

### **Periods of Common Trigonometric Functions**

1.  **Sine (sin θ)**
    *   Pattern repeats every ( 360^\circ ) or ( 2\pi ) radians.
    *   **Period = ( 2\pi )**.

2.  **Cosine (cos θ)**
    *   Same as sine because both are circular functions.
    *   **Period = ( 2\pi )**.

3.  **Tangent (tan θ)**
    *   Repeats every ( 180^\circ ) or ( \pi ) radians.
    *   **Period = ( \pi )**.

4.  **Cotangent (cot θ)**
    *   Same as tangent.
    *   **Period = ( \pi )**.

5.  **Secant (sec θ)** and **Cosecant (csc θ)**
    *   Same as sine and cosine.
    *   **Period = ( 2\pi )**.

***

### **Quick Summary Table**

| Function | Period   |
| -------- | -------- |
| sin(θ)   | ( 2\pi ) |
| cos(θ)   | ( 2\pi ) |
| tan(θ)   | ( \pi )  |

# Law of Sines

***

# ✅ **Law of Sines (Sine Rule)**

For any triangle $$ABC$$:

$$
\frac{a}{\sin A} = \frac{b}{\sin B} = \frac{c}{\sin C}
$$

Where:

*   $$a$$ is the side **opposite angle $$A$$**
*   $$b$$ is the side **opposite angle $$B$$**
*   $$c$$ is the side **opposite angle $$C$$**

***

# ✅ **When to Use the Law of Sines**

Use the sine rule when you know:

### **1. Two angles and one side (AAS or ASA)**

→ You can find the third angle, then use the Law of Sines.

### **2. Two sides and a non‑included angle (SSA)**

→ **Ambiguous case**: sometimes 0, 1, or 2 solutions.

***

# 🇧🇾 **How You Used It in Your Triangle**

Your triangle had:

*   $$A = 93^\circ$$
*   $$B = 14^\circ$$
*   Side opposite $$A$$: $$a = 52$$

First find angle $$C$$:

$$
C = 180^\circ - 93^\circ - 14^\circ = 73^\circ
$$

Now apply the sine rule:

### **Side $$AB = c$$** (opposite $$C$$)

$$
\frac{c}{\sin 73^\circ} = \frac{52}{\sin 93^\circ}
$$

### **Side $$AC = b$$** (opposite $$B$$)

$$
\frac{b}{\sin 14^\circ} = \frac{52}{\sin 93^\circ}
$$

This is exactly how the **Law of Sines** works.

***


# Law of Cosines
***

# ✅ **The Cosine Rule (Law of Cosines)**

For any triangle with sides $$a, b, c$$ opposite angles $$A, B, C$$:

$$
\boxed{a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos A}
$$

$$
b^2 = a^2 + c^2 - 2ac\cos B
$$

$$
c^2 = a^2 + b^2 - 2ab\cos C
$$

***

# 🔍 **When to Use the Cosine Rule**

Use the Cosine Rule when you have:

### **1. Two sides and the included angle (SAS)**

Example: you know $$b$$, $$c$$, and angle $$A$$.  
→ Use $$a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos A$$

### **2. All three sides (SSS)**

Example: you know $$a$$, $$b$$, and $$c$$.  
→ Use the rule to find any angle.

***

# 🧠 **Why the Cosine Rule Works (Simple Derivation)**

Consider a triangle with sides $$b$$ and $$c$$, and angle $$A$$ between them.  
Drop a perpendicular to create a right triangle.

Let $$h$$ be the height, and let the base be split into segments:

*   One segment = $$c\cos A$$
*   Height = $$c\sin A$$

Using the Pythagorean theorem on the full base:

$$
a^2 = (b - c\cos A)^2 + (c\sin A)^2
$$

Expand:

$$
a^2 = b^2 - 2bc\cos A + c^2(\cos^2 A + \sin^2 A)
$$

But:

$$
\cos^2 A + \sin^2 A = 1
$$

So:

$$
\boxed{a^2 = b^2 + c^2 - 2bc\cos A}
$$

This works for any triangle.

***

# 🎯 **Quick Example**

Given:

*   $$b = 7$$
*   $$c = 10$$
*   $$\angle A = 45^\circ$$

Find $$a$$:

$$
a^2 = 7^2 + 10^2 - 2(7)(10)\cos 45^\circ
$$

$$
a^2 = 49 + 100 - 140(0.7071)
$$

$$
a^2 = 149 - 98.994
$$

$$
a \approx 10.102
$$

# Area of Triangle

Here is the **Area of a Triangle Using the Sine Formula**, explained simply and clearly.

***

# ✅ **Area of a Triangle Using Sine**

If you know **two sides** of a triangle and the **included angle** between them, the area is:

$$
\boxed{A = \frac12 ab \sin(C)}
$$

Where:

*   $$a$$ and $$b$$ are two sides,
*   $$C$$ is the angle **between** sides $$a$$ and $$b$$.

***

# 🧠 **Why This Formula Works**

Start with the basic area formula:

$$
A = \frac12 (\text{base})(\text{height})
$$

Choose side $$b$$ as the base.  
Drop a perpendicular from the opposite vertex to form height $$h$$.

In the right triangle formed:

$$
h = a \sin(C)
$$

(Substitute height)

$$
A = \frac12 (b)(a \sin(C))
$$

Rearrange:

$$
\boxed{A = \frac12 ab \sin(C)}
$$

***

# 🎯 **When to Use This Formula**

Use it when triangle info is:

*   **SAS** (Two sides and included angle)
*   Example: $$a = 10$$, $$b = 7$$, $$C = 40^\circ$$

$$
A = \frac12 (10)(7)\sin(40^\circ)
$$

$$
A \approx 22.497
$$

***

# 📌 Summary

$$
\boxed{A = \frac12 ab \sin(C)}
$$
