# Sides forming Angles
In trigonometry, when we talk about **initial side** and **terminal side**, we are referring to the sides of an angle drawn in **standard position** on the coordinate plane.

***

### ✅ **Initial Side**

*   The **initial side** of an angle is the **starting position** of the angle.
*   In standard position, it **always lies along the positive x-axis**.
*   This is the fixed side from which the angle begins to rotate.

***

### ✅ **Terminal Side**

*   The **terminal side** is the **position after rotation**.
*   It shows where the angle ends after rotating from the initial side.
*   The rotation can be:
    *   **Counterclockwise** → Positive angle
    *   **Clockwise** → Negative angle

***

### ✅ **Significance**

*   The initial side is the reference point for measuring angles.
*   The terminal side determines the quadrant of the angle, which affects the **signs of trigonometric functions**.
*   The angle between the initial and terminal side is what we measure in degrees or radians.

# Reference Angles


### ✅ **What is a Reference Angle?**

In trigonometry, a **reference angle** is the **acute angle (between 0° and 90°)** formed between the terminal side of a given angle and the **x-axis** in standard position.

*   For any angle θ (positive or negative), its reference angle is the smallest positive angle between the terminal side of θ and the x-axis.
*   It is always **positive** and **≤ 90°**.

***

### ✅ **How to Find It?**

*   If θ is in **Quadrant I**: Reference angle = θ
*   If θ is in **Quadrant II**: Reference angle = 180° − θ
*   If θ is in **Quadrant III**: Reference angle = θ − 180°
*   If θ is in **Quadrant IV**: Reference angle = 360° − θ  
    *(For radians, use π instead of 180° and 2π instead of 360°.)*

Example:  
If θ = 210°, then reference angle = 210° − 180° = 30°.

***

### ✅ **Significance of Reference Angle**

*   **Simplifies Trigonometric Calculations:**  
    Trig functions of any angle can be expressed using its reference angle and the sign determined by the quadrant.
    $`
    \sin(210°) = -\sin(30°), \quad \cos(210°) = -\cos(30°)
    `$
*   **Helps with Unit Circle:**  
    All trig values repeat in patterns based on reference angles.
*   **Useful for Negative Angles and Angles > 360°:**  
    You reduce them to their reference angle for easier computation.

# All Students Take Calculus
- Purpose: Helps determine the sign (+ or -) of trig functions in each quadrant.
- How it Works (Counter-clockwise from Quadrant I):
  - All: All functions (Sin, Cos, Tan) are positive. <br/>
  - Sine: Sine (and its reciprocal, Cosecant) are positive. <br/>
  - Tangent: Tangent (and Cotangent) are positive. <br/>
  - Cosine: Cosine (and Secant) are positive.  <br/>

# Trignometric Addition Identities

Trigonometric **addition identities** are formulas that allow you to find the sine, cosine, or tangent of the sum or difference of two angles. These are fundamental in trigonometry because they help simplify expressions and solve problems involving angle sums.

### ✅ **Addition and Subtraction Formulas**

1.  **Sine Addition/Subtraction**
    $`
    \sin(A \pm B) = \sin A \cos B \pm \cos A \sin B
    `$

*   For **addition**:
    $`
    \sin(A + B) = \sin A \cos B + \cos A \sin B
    `$
*   For **subtraction**:
    $`
    \sin(A - B) = \sin A \cos B - \cos A \sin B
    `$

***

2.  **Cosine Addition/Subtraction**
    $`
    \cos(A \pm B) = \cos A \cos B \mp \sin A \sin B
    `$

*   For **addition**:
    $`
    \cos(A + B) = \cos A \cos B - \sin A \sin B
    `$
*   For **subtraction**:
    $`
    \cos(A - B) = \cos A \cos B + \sin A \sin B
    `$

***

3.  **Tangent Addition/Subtraction**
    $`
    \tan(A \pm B) = \frac{\tan A \pm \tan B}{1 \mp \tan A \tan B}
    `$

*   For **addition**:
    $`
    \tan(A + B) = \frac{\tan A + \tan B}{1 - \tan A \tan B}
    `$
*   For **subtraction**:
    $`
    \tan(A - B) = \frac{\tan A - \tan B}{1 + \tan A \tan B}
    `$

***

### ✅ Why are these useful?

*   They help simplify expressions like (\cos(t + 3.5\pi)) (as in your previous question).
*   They are used in proving identities, solving trigonometric equations, and in calculus for integration and differentiation.
