# Asset
An **asset** in a company is any resource owned or controlled by the business that has economic value and can provide future benefits. Assets are recorded on the company’s balance sheet and are essential for operations, growth, and generating revenue.

### **Types of Assets**

1.  **Current Assets** (short-term, easily converted to cash within a year):
    *   **Cash & Cash Equivalents** (bank balances, petty cash)
    *   **Accounts Receivable** (money owed by customers)

# Liability

***
# Owner's Equity

**Owner’s Equity** (also called **Shareholders’ Equity** or **Net Worth**) represents the residual interest in the company’s assets after deducting liabilities. In simple terms:

$`
\text{Owner’s Equity} = \text{Assets} - \text{Liabilities}
`$

It shows how much of the company is owned by its shareholders or owners.

***

### **Components of Owner’s Equity**

1.  **Capital Contributions**
    *   Money invested by owners or shareholders.
    *   Example: Initial investment of $100,000 by the founder.

2.  **Retained Earnings**
    *   Profits kept in the business instead of being distributed as dividends.
    *   Example: $50,000 profit retained from previous years.

3.  **Additional Paid-In Capital**
    *   Amount paid by shareholders above the par value of shares.
    *   Example: Shares issued at $10 when par value is $1.

4.  **Treasury Stock** (negative equity)
    *   Shares repurchased by the company.
    *   Example: Company buys back $20,000 worth of its own shares.

***

### **Examples**

*   A small business with:
    *   **Assets** = $500,000
    *   **Liabilities** = $300,000  
        → **Owner’s Equity** = $200,000

*   For a corporation:
    *   **Common Stock** = $100,000
    *   **Retained Earnings** = $250,000
    *   **Treasury Stock** = -$50,000  
        → Total Owner’s Equity = $300,000

# KEY TERMINOLGIES

The **Quick Ratio** (also called the **Acid-Test Ratio**) is a liquidity metric that measures a company’s ability to meet its short-term obligations using its most liquid assets—excluding inventory.

***

### **Formula**

$`
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets} - \text{Inventory}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
`$
***

### **Why exclude inventory?**

Inventory is less liquid than cash or receivables because it takes time to sell and convert into cash. The quick ratio focuses on assets that can be quickly turned into cash.

***

### **Interpretation**

*   **Quick Ratio > 1:** Company has more liquid assets than current liabilities → good short-term financial health.
*   **Quick Ratio < 1:** Company may struggle to cover short-term obligations without selling inventory.

***

### **Example using TechNova Inc.**

From the Balance Sheet:

*   **Current Assets:** Cash ($150,000) + Accounts Receivable ($100,000) + Inventory ($50,000) = $300,000
*   **Current Liabilities:** Accounts Payable ($70,000) + Short-term Debt ($30,000) = $100,000

$`
\text{Quick Ratio} = \frac{300{,}000 - 50{,}000}{100{,}000} = \frac{250{,}000}{100{,}000} = 2.5
`$

**Meaning:** TechNova has $2.50 in liquid assets for every $1 of current liabilities → very strong liquidity.

***

Here’s a detailed explanation of the two ratios for **TechNova Inc.**:

***

### **1. Current Ratio**

**Formula:**
$`
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{\text{Current Assets}}{\text{Current Liabilities}}
`$

From TechNova’s Balance Sheet:

*   **Current Assets:** $150,000 (Cash) + $100,000 (Accounts Receivable) + $50,000 (Inventory) = **$300,000**
*   **Current Liabilities:** $70,000 (Accounts Payable) + $30,000 (Short-term Debt) = **$100,000**

$`
\text{Current Ratio} = \frac{300{,}000}{100{,}000} = 3.0
`$

**Interpretation:**  
TechNova has $3 in current assets for every $1 in current liabilities → excellent short-term liquidity.

***

### **2. Debt-to-Equity Ratio**

**Formula:**
$`
\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{\text{Total Liabilities}}{\text{Shareholders’ Equity}}
`$

From TechNova’s Balance Sheet:

*   **Total Liabilities:** $300,000
*   **Equity:** $500,000

$`
\text{Debt-to-Equity} = \frac{300{,}000}{500{,}000} = 0.6
`$

**Interpretation:**  
For every $1 of equity, TechNova has $0.60 of debt → moderate leverage, generally considered healthy.

***

✅ **Summary of Ratios:**

*   **Quick Ratio:** 2.5 (very strong liquidity)
*   **Current Ratio:** 3.0 (excellent liquidity)
*   **Debt-to-Equity:** 0.6 (balanced capital structure)

***

**Working Capital** is a measure of a company’s short-term financial health and operational efficiency. It represents the difference between **current assets** and **current liabilities**.

***

### **Formula**

$`
\text{Working Capital} = \text{Current Assets} - \text{Current Liabilities}
`$

***

### **Interpretation**

*   **Positive Working Capital:** The company can cover its short-term obligations and still have resources left for operations → generally healthy.
*   **Negative Working Capital:** The company may struggle to pay short-term debts → potential liquidity risk.

***

### **Example with TechNova Inc.**

From the Balance Sheet:

*   **Current Assets:** $300,000 (Cash + Accounts Receivable + Inventory)
*   **Current Liabilities:** $100,000 (Accounts Payable + Short-term Debt)

$`
\text{Working Capital} = 300{,}000 - 100{,}000 = 200{,}000
`$

**Meaning:** TechNova has $200,000 more in current assets than current liabilities → strong short-term financial position.

***

✅ **Key Insight:**  
Working Capital is a raw number, while **Current Ratio** and **Quick Ratio** are relative measures. All three together give a complete picture of liquidity.

***
