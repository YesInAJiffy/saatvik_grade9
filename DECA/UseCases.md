Here’s an **elaborate write-up** you can use for the role-play scenario as the junior banker at TOWN BANK:

***

### **Role-Play Script for Junior Banker**

**Customer (Judge):** *“I just opened my first savings and checking account here at TOWN BANK. I’m earning a paycheck for the first time and I’m excited to spend on entertainment and clothing. I’m also thinking about getting a credit card for more spending power. Can you tell me more about personal finance?”*

***

**Junior Banker (You):**

“Congratulations on opening your first accounts and starting your financial journey! Personal finance is all about managing your money wisely so you can meet your short-term and long-term goals. Let me walk you through a few important concepts.”

***

#### **1. Financial Goals**

“Financial goals are the targets you set for your money. They can be short-term, like saving for a new phone or a vacation, or long-term, like buying a home or planning for retirement. Setting goals helps you stay focused and make smart decisions about spending and saving.”

***

#### **2. The Need to Save and Invest**

“Saving is essential because it gives you a safety net for emergencies and helps you reach your goals. Your savings account is a great start—it’s secure and earns interest. Over time, you might also consider investing, which means putting money into things like stocks or bonds to grow your wealth. Investing is important for long-term goals because it can help your money work for you.”

***

#### **3. The Wise Use of Credit**

“Credit can be helpful, but it needs to be used wisely. A credit card gives you convenience and flexibility, but it’s not free money. You should only spend what you can pay back on time. Paying your balance in full each month avoids interest charges and keeps your debt under control.”

***

#### **4. The Purpose and Importance of Credit**

“Credit is more than just borrowing—it’s about building a financial reputation. When you use credit responsibly, you build a good credit history and credit score. This is important because it affects your ability to get loans for big purchases like a car or a home, and even the interest rates you’ll pay. Good credit can save you a lot of money over time.”

***

**Junior Banker (You):**
“So, in summary: set clear financial goals, save and invest for the future, use credit wisely, and build a strong credit history. If you’d like, I can help you set up a budget or explain how our credit card options work.”

***

**Customer (Judge):** *“Thank you for explaining everything so clearly. I appreciate your help!”*

***

✅ This script covers all required points in a conversational tone and positions you as helpful and knowledgeable.

Here’s an **elaborate role-play script** for your scenario:

***

### **Role-Play Script: Bank Teller at COUNTY BANK**

**Customer (Judge):**  
*"I haven’t received my paper bank statements in the mail for the last two months. Why is this happening? I need access to my account information!"*

***

**Bank Teller (You):**  
*"I completely understand your concern, and I appreciate you bringing this to my attention. Let me explain our new statement policy so everything is clear."*

***

#### **Explain the Policy**

*"Three months ago, COUNTY BANK introduced a new option for customers regarding paper statements. We asked all customers to either **opt-in** to continue receiving paper statements or **opt-out** to switch to digital statements. If no choice was made, the system automatically opted customers out of paper statements for convenience and security."*

***

#### **Reassure and Offer Solutions**

*"Your account information is still fully accessible through our secure online banking platform. You can log in anytime to view or download your statements. If you prefer paper statements, I can help you opt back in right now so you’ll start receiving them again."*

***

#### **Positive Customer Relations**

*"I understand this change might have been unexpected, and I’m here to make sure you have the access you need. Would you like me to walk you through setting up online access or process your opt-in for paper statements today?"*

***

**Customer (Judge):**  
*"Yes, please help me opt back in. Thank you for explaining everything."*
