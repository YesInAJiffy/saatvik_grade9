Here’s a clear and concise explanation for each of your questions:

***

### **1. What is the Renaissance?**

The **Renaissance** was a cultural, artistic, intellectual, and scientific revival that began in Europe around the 14th century and lasted into the 17th century. The term means “rebirth,” referring to the renewed interest in the classical ideas of ancient Greece and Rome. It marked a transition from the medieval period to the modern age, emphasizing humanism, individualism, and secularism.

***

### **2. Why Italy? Why did the Renaissance occur in Italy? (Two reasons)**

**Reason 1: Historical and Cultural Legacy**
Italy was the heart of the Roman Empire, so it had a wealth of classical ruins, texts, and art that inspired scholars and artists to revive ancient knowledge and aesthetics.

**Reason 2: Economic Prosperity and Patronage**
Italian city-states like Florence, Venice, and Milan were wealthy due to trade and banking. This wealth allowed powerful families (like the Medici in Florence) to sponsor artists, architects, and scholars, fueling the Renaissance.
