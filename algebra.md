### **Definition**

A **zero** (or root) of a polynomial is a value of (x) that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

A **rational zero** is a root that can be expressed as a **fraction of two integers**:
$`
\text{rational number} = \frac{p}{q}, \text{ where } p, q \text{ are integers and } q \neq 0.
`$

 So if a polynomial $` f(x) `$ has a rational zero, plugging that number into $` f(x) `$ gives:
$`
f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = 0.
`$
***

### **Example**

For the polynomial:
$` 
f(x) = x^3 + 14x^2 + 41x - 56
`$

 If (x = 1) makes (f(x)=0), then (1) is a rational zero because $` 1 = (\frac{1}{1}). 
 `$

***

### **Why is it important?**

*   Rational zeros are easier to find than irrational or complex roots.
*   The **Rational Root Theorem** gives a list of all possible rational zeros based on the polynomial’s coefficients.

***

✅ **In short:** Rational zeros are roots that are rational numbers (fractions or whole numbers).


***

✅ **Key Point:** These are only **possible roots**. Some may not actually work.

***


Here are the results for the polynomial:
$` 
f(x) = x^3 + 14x^2 + 41x - 56
`$
***

### ✅ **Possible Rational Roots** (from Rational Root Theorem)
$` 
\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 7, \pm 8, \pm 14, \pm 28, \pm 56
`$
***

### ✅ **Actual Rational Roots**
$` 
x = 1,; x = -7,; x = -8
`$
***

### ✅ **Factorization**
$` 
x^3 + 14x^2 + 41x - 56 = (x - 1)(x + 7)(x + 8)
`$

Great question! The orientation of a parabola depends on the **variable that is squared** and the **sign of its coefficient** in the equation. Here’s how to determine it:

***

### ✅ **1. Standard Forms of Parabolas**

*   **Vertical parabola (opens up or down):**
    $`
    y = ax^2 + bx + c \quad \text{or} \quad (x - h)^2 = 4p(y - k)
    `$
    *   If **x is squared**, the parabola opens **upward or downward**.
    *   **Sign of (a) or (p):**
        *   (a > 0) or (p > 0): **Opens upward**
        *   (a < 0) or (p < 0): **Opens downward**

*   **Horizontal parabola (opens left or right):**
    $`
    x = ay^2 + by + c \quad \text{or} \quad (y - k)^2 = 4p(x - h)
    `$
    *   If **y is squared**, the parabola opens **left or right**.
    *   **Sign of (p):**
        *   (p > 0): **Opens right**
        *   (p < 0): **Opens left**

***

### ✅ **2. Quick Rules**

*   **x² term → vertical parabola**
    *   Positive coefficient → **up**
    *   Negative coefficient → **down**
*   **y² term → horizontal parabola**
    *   Positive coefficient → **right**
    *   Negative coefficient → **left**

***

### ✅ **3. Examples**

*   $` (y = 2x^2 + 3x - 1) `$ → **x² term**, (a = 2 > 0) → **opens upward**
*   $` (y = -x^2 + 4x + 5) `$ → **x² term**, (a = -1 < 0) → **opens downward**
*   $` (x = (y - 3)^2 + 2) `$ → **y² term**, positive → **opens right**
*   $` (x = -(y + 1)^2 + 5) `$ → **y² term**, negative → **opens left**
