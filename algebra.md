### **Definition**

A **zero** (or root) of a polynomial is a value of (x) that makes the polynomial equal to zero.

A **rational zero** is a root that can be expressed as a **fraction of two integers**:
$`
\text{rational number} = \frac{p}{q}, \text{ where } p, q \text{ are integers and } q \neq 0.
`$

 So if a polynomial $` f(x) `$ has a rational zero, plugging that number into $` f(x) `$ gives:
$`
f\left(\frac{p}{q}\right) = 0.

### **Example**

For the polynomial:
$` 
f(x) = x^3 + 14x^2 + 41x - 56
`$

 If (x = 1) makes (f(x)=0), then (1) is a rational zero because $` 1 = (\frac{1}{1}).

### **Why is it important?**

*   Rational zeros are easier to find than irrational or complex roots.
*   The **Rational Root Theorem** gives a list of all possible rational zeros based on the polynomial’s coefficients.

***

✅ **In short:** Rational zeros are roots that are rational numbers (fractions or whole numbers).


***

✅ **Key Point:** These are only **possible roots**. Some may not actually work.

***


Here are the results for the polynomial:
$` 

f(x) = x^3 + 14x^2 + 41x - 56

### ✅ **Possible Rational Roots** (from Rational Root Theorem)
$` 

\pm 1, \pm 2, \pm 4, \pm 7, \pm 8, \pm 14, \pm 28, \pm 56

`$
***

### ✅ **Actual Rational Roots**
$` 

x = 1,; x = -7,; x = -8

`$
***

### ✅ **Factorization**
$` 

x^3 + 14x^2 + 41x - 56 = (x - 1)(x + 7)(x + 8)
