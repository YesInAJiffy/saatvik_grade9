# Lever
A **lever** is a simple machine that helps you apply force more efficiently by using a rigid bar that pivots around a point called the **fulcrum**.

***

### **Definition**

A lever is a rigid bar that rotates around a fixed point (fulcrum) to move or lift a load using less effort.

***

### **How It Works**

*   You apply **effort** at one end.
*   The **load** (object you want to move) is at the other end.
*   The **fulcrum** is the pivot point in between.
*   The farther your effort is from the fulcrum, the easier it is to lift the load because you increase the **lever arm** (distance).

***

### **Formula**

\[
\text{Torque} = \text{Force} \times \text{Lever Arm Length}
]

***

### **Example**

*   A seesaw is a lever.
*   A wrench turning a bolt is also a lever—the bolt is the fulcrum, the wrench is the bar, and your hand applies effort.

***

<img width="1536" height="1024" alt="Designer-8" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d37e5957-0293-4df8-be75-e672b7463f65" />
<img width="888" height="398" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/d6e01850-9c81-46d4-88f8-0026db3516ba" />

This image shows a **lever in action** with two weights:

*   **Left side**: A large sphere labeled **100 kg** (the heavy load).
*   **Right side**: A smaller sphere labeled **5 kg** (the effort).
*   **Fulcrum**: The triangular support under the wooden plank, closer to the heavy load.
*   **Plank**: Acts as the lever arm.

***

### **Explanation**

*   The lever is **not balanced** because the heavy load (100 kg) is much closer to the fulcrum, while the lighter effort (5 kg) is farther away.
*   This demonstrates **mechanical advantage**:
    *   By placing the effort farther from the fulcrum, you increase the **lever arm length**, which multiplies the torque.
    *   Even though the effort is much lighter (5 kg), its greater distance from the fulcrum can balance or lift the heavier load.

***

### **Key Principle**

\[
\text{Torque} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance from Fulcrum}
]
So:

*   Heavy load: Large force, short distance.
*   Light effort: Small force, long distance.

If the distances are adjusted correctly, the torques can balance.

***



# Torque
**Torque** is a measure of **rotational force**—how strongly something can twist or turn around an axis.

***

### **Definition**

Torque is the force that causes rotation.  
Mathematically:
\[
\text{Torque} = \text{Force} \times \text{Distance from pivot (lever arm)}
]

***

### **Example**

*   When you use a wrench to turn a bolt:
    *   If you push harder (more force), torque increases.
    *   If you use a longer wrench (more distance), torque also increases.
*   In robotics:
    *   A motor with **high torque** can lift heavy arms but moves slowly.
    *   A motor with **low torque** spins fast but can’t lift heavy loads.

***

### **Units**

Torque is measured in **Newton-meters (N·m)** or **inch-pounds (in·lb)**.

***

### **Why It Matters**

*   High torque = more strength for heavy tasks.
*   Low torque = more speed for light tasks.

***

The above diagram
+ Shows a wrench turning a bolt.
+ Force applied at the end of the wrench.
+ Lever arm is the distance from the bolt to where the force is applied.
+ Torque = Force × Lever Arm.

✅ This visual makes it clear why a longer wrench gives more torque—because the lever arm is longer.

**Gear ratio** is a way to describe the relationship between two gears that are connected together. It tells you how many times one gear turns compared to the other.

***

### **Definition**

Gear ratio =  
\[
\text{Number of teeth on driven gear} \div \text{Number of teeth on driving gear}
]

***

### **Example**

*   If a **small gear with 10 teeth** drives a **large gear with 50 teeth**, the gear ratio is:
    \[
    50 \div 10 = 5:1
    ]
    This means the small gear must turn **5 times** for the large gear to turn **once**.

***

### **NOTE**

Gear ratio can be expressed in two ways:

*   **Driven : Driving** (common in robotics) → Higher ratio = more torque.
*   **Driving : Driven** (sometimes used in bikes) → Higher ratio = more speed.

So the meaning depends on **which gear you call “first” in the ratio**.

***


### **How Bicycle Gears Work**

*   A bicycle has **front chainrings** (attached to pedals) and **rear sprockets** (attached to the wheel).
*   The **gear ratio** is:
    \[
    \text{Number of teeth on front chainring} \div \text{Number of teeth on rear sprocket}
    ]

***

### **Example**

*   Front chainring: **50 teeth**
*   Rear sprocket: **25 teeth**
    \[
    \text{Gear ratio} = 50 \div 25 = 2:1
    ]
    This means **one pedal turn makes the rear wheel turn twice**.

***

### **Effect on Speed and Effort**

*   **High gear ratio (big front gear, small rear gear)**:
    *   Harder to pedal
    *   More speed per pedal turn
*   **Low gear ratio (small front gear, big rear gear)**:
    *   Easier to pedal (good for hills)
    *   Less speed per pedal turn

***

Why **a high gear ratio is harder to pedal**:

***

### **What is a High Gear Ratio?**

*   High gear ratio means **large front chainring** and **small rear sprocket**.
*   Example: Front gear = 50 teeth, Rear gear = 10 teeth → Ratio = 5:1.

***

### **Why It’s Harder**

*   For every **one turn of the pedals**, the rear wheel turns **five times**.
*   This gives **more speed**, but the force you apply is spread over fewer teeth on the rear sprocket.
*   So, you need **more torque (rotational force)** at the pedals to overcome resistance (especially when starting or climbing hills).

***

### **Think of Leverage**

*   Low gear ratio = like a long lever → easier to push, but moves slowly.
*   High gear ratio = short lever → harder to push, but moves fast.

***

Here’s a clear comparison of **Higher Gear Ratio vs Lower Gear Ratio - FOR BICYCLES** in a table:

| **Feature**              | **Higher Gear Ratio** (e.g., 50:10 = 5:1) | **Lower Gear Ratio** (e.g., 20:40 = 1:2) |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| **Pedaling Effort**      | Harder to pedal                           | Easier to pedal                          |
| **Speed**                | Higher speed per pedal turn               | Lower speed per pedal turn               |
| **Torque at Wheel**      | Lower torque (less pulling power)         | Higher torque (more pulling power)       |
| **Best For**             | Flat roads, going fast                    | Climbing hills, starting from stop       |
| **Mechanical Advantage** | Low (short lever effect)                  | High (long lever effect)                 |
