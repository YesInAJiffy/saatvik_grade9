Today’s adventure took us to one of Boston’s most iconic attractions — Franklin Park Zoo. 

It sits on 72 acres inside historic Franklin Park and is operated by Zoo New England. 


We visited on a full-on snow day, and it felt genuinely magical — quiet paths, a fresh white blanket everywhere, and animals enjoying the winter calm.

Bird’s World is housed in one of the zoo’s original buildings from its early days in the early 1900s—it has this classic, old‑world zoo charm that you don’t see very often anymore. 

Kalahari Kingdom mirrors the African landscape, with open sight-lines and  rocky outcrops. The lion was lying on top of a rock, resting.


One of my favorite moments was stepping into the Tropical Forest. The second you walk through the doors, it feels like you’ve been transported from snowy Boston to a warm, humid rainforest.

Along the way, we learned some awesome animal facts:


Anteaters don’t have teeth, yet a giant anteater can eat up to ~30,000 ants or termites a day. 

Hippos don’t “swim” like fish. Instead, they walk or bound along the river bottom, and adults can typically hold their breath for about 3–5 minutes

Gorillas share around 98% of their DNA with humans.
Watching them is mesmerizing—you can read curiosity, calm, frustration, and happiness in their expressions. 

And while they often seem relaxed, a fully grown gorilla is about four to nine times stronger than an average human.

All in all, it was a fantastic visit. The snow, the peaceful atmosphere, and the animals made it feel extra special.

If you’re in or around Boston, definitely put Franklin Park Zoo on your list — and if you ever get a snow day, go for it! ❄️🦍🐘
